## 📁 About the Repository
This is a portfolio-ready version of the original system. All secret keys and credentials (e.g., SMS, email API keys) have been intentionally removed for security.
While the original project was team-based, this repository reflects my own contributions and architectural decisions throughout the development process, including backend design, feature planning, and core implementation.
